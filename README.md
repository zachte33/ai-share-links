## Compatibility

### Performance Optimization Plugins
AI Share Links is fully compatible with popular optimization plugins:
- ✅ **Perfmatters** - Works with "Remove Global Styles" and "Separate Block Styles" enabled
- ✅ **WP Rocket** - Compatible with block CSS removal and optimization features
- ✅ **Autoptimize** - CSS and JS optimization supported
- ✅ **Asset CleanUp** - Works with disabled WordPress core styles

The plugin uses direct CSS injection to `wp_head` rather than depending on WordPress block library styles, ensuring buttons render correctly even when core block styles are disabled for performance.
